title: What’s Important in Life?
tags: personal
excerpt: "The most important realization in life is that other people are just as real, just as meaningful, just as important as you are."

I stumbled on Richard Muller's [answer on Quora](https://qr.ae/Rwm1ut) to the question "How do you realize what is really important in life?". He really nailed it, in my opinion. I will be making an effort to keep this top-of-mind:

> This may sound trivial, since it has been said so many times:  
>
> The most important realization in life is that other people are just as real, just as meaningful, just as important as you are.  
>
> You'll recognize that what makes the things you do important is the impact that they have on others.  You'll realize that you have "eternal life" as long as others live.  
>
> The key to everything is empathy.  The Golden Rule is just a consequence of empathy.
