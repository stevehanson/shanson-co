A couple years ago, I decided to build a little Chrome extension to help me manage switching between multiple development environments in my browser. I wanted to be able to switch quickly between, say, `localhost:3000/about`, `my-site.dev/about`, `my-site.com/about`, etc.

To be honest, a big part of my motivation for actually finishing the Chrome extension was that a friend and mentor at the time, Cody Case, had offered me free lunch if I completed it and released it to the Chrome Store. That got me going, and in November of 2013, I released [Domain Switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domain-switcher/lbehdhpgigdlinfkidifkbhjnaglfojc).

I just checked back, and the extension has passed 1,000 weekly users. It makes me happy to know that the little utility I wrote for myself is also helping some other people!
