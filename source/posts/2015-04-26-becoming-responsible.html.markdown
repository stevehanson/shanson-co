excerpt: I’m disorganized and have no goals. Let’s see if I can get things together.

I've never really been much of a planner or been very organized. I tend to just take things as they come, and I think I do OK. But lately, my life has been pretty busy, and I've realized that I could probably make some improvements to optimize how I prioritize things and spend my time. I've been dreading this, though :).

Basically, I recently realized that, in a given day, I rarely accomplish what I set out to. And I think it's because I suck at prioritizing things. I end up getting sidetracked and neglecting what I really should be doing.

I also generally have a vague feeling in the back of my head that I’m forgetting something. This stress never really allows me to relax, while I try to juggle everything in my head. Planning and getting organized could really help me here.

#### My Plan for Success

I’ve always known that I’m a poor planner and am disorganized, but I’ve never before put a plan in place to get better (do you see the chicken and egg problem here?). Today, I figured I would go against my nature and put a loose plan of action together. Here it is:

- Wake up 30 minutes early, at least 4 times per week, to plan my day
- Time-box my activities. Plan ahead of time how much time I’ll spend on things. If I can finish early, I just got time back!
- Segment work and life. When I’m at home, unless I didn’t finish something at work, tell that “vague feeling that you should be doing something for work” to go away

The _plan_ is to try this out for two weeks and then go from there.

Until next time.
