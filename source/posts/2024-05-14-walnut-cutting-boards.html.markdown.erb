I made my first cutting boards in January as gifts for my mom's and brother's
birthdays.  Cutting boards are a fun project, because their function is
simpleâ€”the goal is just to have a flat wooden surface to cut onâ€”but there are
also a lot of opportunities for creativity.

For this project, I decided to make end grain walnut cutting boards. Here's a
picture of the finished project first:

Now, on to the details!

I went to my local lumber yard, [Fine Lumber](https://www.finelumber.com/), and
picked out one piece of 8/4 (i.e. 2" thick) walnut that was about 9' long by 7"
wide. This cost $140 at about $12 per board foot. My plan was to make three
cutting boards out of this, each about 12" x 18".

End grain cutting boards are made by cutting the wood into strips and then
gluing the strips back together so that the end grain is facing up. They're a
little easier on knives and resistant to deep gashes. I also like the way they
look.

Here's a preview at what my process would be:

  <figcaption>
    I'll first divide the board into three pieces, each about 3' long.

</figure>

And here's how we turn one of those three pieces into an end grain cutting board:

<%= image_tag "cutting-boards/cuts-02.svg", alt: "Image showing the cuts. First, the board is cross-cut in half. Then, the two pieces are glued together along the length. Then, the board is cross-cut into strips. Finally, each strip is flipped onto its edge, alternating, so the end grain is facing up before it is all glued together" %>

Alright, let's get to the build:

  <figcaption>
    Next I ran the boards through the planer to get
    them flat. I don't have a jointer, so I used a homemade sled with shims as I passed the boards through the planer. My son Sammy helped me mark the boards with pencil so I could see where I needed to remove material.

  <figcaption>
    Next, I glued the two pieces together. I glued the lighter-colored sapwood sides to each other. I selected this board at the lumber yard because of the diagonal sapwood that can be seen on the endgrain, which is what will create a diamond pattern on the finished piece.

  <figcaption>
    Now, I cut the board into 1.5" strips using I used a crosscut sled on the table saw to do this, with a stop block to make sure all the pieces were the same length. The cross-cut sled was another recent project. As you can see, the kids helped me design it ðŸ¦„.

  <%= lazy_image_tag "cutting-boards/build-06.jpeg", alt: "Glue applied to the boards" %>
  <figcaption>
    At this point, I played around quite a bit with flipping and arranging the pieces till I got a pattern I liked. Once I was happy, I glued them all together with Titebond II Dark. After applying the glue and taking this picture, I flipped the boards and then clamped.

  <figcaption>
    After the glue dried, I ran the board through the planer to get it flat. I
    was hesitant about running end grain through the planer, but I didn't have
    any issues. I first sanded a chamfer on the back edge so it wouldn't tear
    out and then took very light passes through the planer.

   Filled a couple knots with black-dyed epoxy. I arranged the boards beforehand so these would be on the bottom. This picture was taken on New Years Eve, so I think I was allowed to still have the Christmas tree up.

    Now it was time to route a chamfer on all the edges. I used a 45-degree chamfer bit in my router table.

  <%= lazy_image_tag "cutting-boards/build-11.jpeg", alt: "Router table set up with fence and cove bit. Board is standing up on edge" %>
  <figcaption>
    Then, I routed finger holds on the sides. I used a cove bit in my router table for this.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <%= lazy_image_tag "cutting-boards/build-12.jpeg", alt: "Picture of the cutting board" %>
  <figcaption>
   Getting close! Chamfers and finger holds routed. Now I just need to sand and finish.

  <figcaption>
    I skipped over a few days while I built the second cutting board. I used a slightly different design on the second board, that I won't go into in this post. Now, I'm sanding the boards to prep for finish.

  <%= lazy_image_tag "cutting-boards/build-14.jpeg", alt: "Picture of a cutting board immersed in mineral oil" %>
  <figcaption>
    Bath time! I soaked the boards in mineral oil for about 30 minutes on each side. I then wiped off the excess and let them dry overnight before applying board butter (a beeswax and mineral oil mixture).
