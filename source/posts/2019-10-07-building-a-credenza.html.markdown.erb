These past few years, I've slowly been getting more and more into woodworking as
a hobby. I decided this year to challenge myself and make a more serious piece
of furniture than I had before, and I set off to build a mid-century modern
style credenza.

I'm really happy with how it turned out. Here are a couple photos of the
finished credenza first:

It was a long process getting to the finished piece, full of lots of learning
and firsts for me. This is my attempt at documenting it. Let's get started!

### Learning what I don't know

Before even starting with designing the credenza, I had to fill a big knowledge
gap. I had never built anything as complex as I knew this piece would be,
so there was a lot to learn. YouTubers like [Chris
Salamone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1V-DYqsaj764uBis9-UDug) of _Four
Eyes_ and [Steve
Ramsey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBB7sYb14uBtk8UqSQYc9-w) of
_Woodworking for Mere Mortals_ among others were invaluable for me while I was
educating myself.

After watching a lot of videos and reading random articles on the internet, I
decided I would make the credenza out of walnut, because it is a common wood
used for mid-century pieces and has a nice grain pattern and a rich natural
color that doesn't need any stain. I decided to use 3/4" walnut veneered plywood
for most everything and then 3/4" solid walnut edging on the front of the
cabinet to hide the plywood ends. I would use mitered 45Â° corners where the top
and sides meet for a polished look and so I wouldn't have to worry about adding
edging on the sides.

Now that I had a general idea for the techniques I would need and the materials
I would be using, it was time to start designing.

### Design time!

One of the reasons I decided to build this credenza is that I had very specific
dimensions that I was looking for. It was going in a walkway, so I didn't want
it to be too deep, and I had limited space for the width. I also had to take
into account what I could achieve using a single 4' x 8' sheet of plywood. Since
the plywood would be the most expensive part, and since I wasn't even sure if
this project would work out, I wanted to keep it to a single sheet. I started
drawing out some designs to get a feel for dimensions that I thought looked
good.

I've used [SketchUp Make](https://www.sketchup.com/download/make) for designing
several projects now and highly recommend it for planning out these sorts of
things. I find it helpful to be able to view my project to scale and then
play around with different dimensions to get the look I want. Here's the design
I put together:

<%= image_tag "credenza/design-sketchup.png", alt: "3D rendering of credenza design" %>

And here you can see several iterations where I was tweaking various dimensions.
That's a lot of ZZ plants:

<%= image_tag "credenza/design-sketchup-iterations.png", alt: "3D rendering with several different versions of the credenza plans" %>

After seeing the designs, taking into account the space where the credenza would
go, and checking that I could fit everything on a single sheet of plywood, I
decided on my dimensions: 15" deep x 49" wide x 30.5" high. Here's a rough plan
of the cuts from my pocket notebook showing how I would lay them out on a 4' x
8' panel  (sorry for the quality):

<%= image_tag "credenza/design-cuts.png", alt: "cut-list for the pieces out of a 4 foot by 8 foot sheet of plywood" %>

As can be seen above, I wanted the top and sides to come from a continuous strip
of the wood so there would be continuous grain from the sides up to the top. I
can't remember why the picture has 53" width instead of 49".

I also planned to buy a 4' x 8' sheet of 1/4" walnut plywood to use for two
sliding doors and for the backing. I would end up with half a sheet left over.

### Time to build

Now that I had the design and cuts all figured out, I was ready to get started.
I rented a truck from Home Depot and went to [Fine
Lumber](https://finelumber.com) with a friend to help me out and bought:

* 1 4'x8' sheet of 3/4" thick walnut veneered plywood
* 1 4'x8' sheet of 1/4" walnut plywood (for the two sliding doors and the
  backing)
* 6 linear feet of 1"x4" (actual 3/4" x 3.5") solid walnut

<figure>

  <figcaption>

    for his project we were working on together
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I don't have pictures of these first couple cuts, but I ripped the plywood into
the three length-wise cuts from my cut list using my table saw. Once I had the
long 8' strips, I needed to cut them width-wise. The table saw can only cut
pieces up to 24" wide, so I had to cut the pieces for the top and bottom to
width using my circular saw. The side pieces were small enough to fit on the
table saw. Here's the box dry-fitted together, with some mineral spirits wiped
on to give an idea of what the color would end up like:

<%= image_tag "credenza/dry-fit-01.jpeg", alt: "The top, bottom, and sides fitted together roughly" %>

You can see above that there's some tear-out on the edge of the top piece where
I had cut with my circular saw. I had figured this might happen since my
circular saw is battery powered and has a dull blade. To fix this, I used my
router with a flush trim bit to trim about a half inch off each side of the top
and bottom pieces, using another straight board as a guide. It's hard to
explain, and this picture doesn't really help, but you can see that there's no
more tear-out:

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

It was pretty tedious doing this on both sides of the top and bottom pieces.

### Dados, rabbets, and other creatures

Next up was for me to cut rabbets and dados into the top and bottom pieces. I
didn't know these words before I started. A dado is a joint where you cut a
notch out of wood so you can fit another piece into the notch. A rabbet is the
same thing, except the notch is on the end of the piece of wood.

My plan was to use a router to make the following cuts:

- a 3/4" thick dado for each of the two dividers
- a 1/4" thick rabbet in the back so the 1/4" backing could be installed flush
- a thin rabbet and a dado for the two door tracks (the edge trim would later enclose the front track where the rabbet is)

Hopefully these pictures will help:

  <figcaption>

    this piece and the sides and top so the backing will fit flush.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I started with the rabbet and dado for the two tracks for the sliding doors.

#### Routing the track for the sliding doors

There would be two sliding doors made out of 1/4" walnut plywood. My plan was
for each door to have its own track, slightly wider than 1/4". I cut the door
tracks by clamping a board down as a guide for the router and using a straight
bit. It was somewhat difficult to figure out where to clamp the guide board. I
had to measure the distance from the edge of the router guide to the edge of the
bit and clamp the board that distance away. Alternatively, it's not too hard to
make some [interesting jigs](https://youtu.be/gyp9EGhM368?t=137) for this sort
of thing, which I haven't tried yet.

  <figcaption>After cutting the tracks</figcaption>
</figure>

The tracks look decent in that picture, but you can't see my one big mistake. The wood I was using as a router guide moved, and the router went off track:

<figure>
  <%= image_tag "credenza/build-track-03.jpeg", alt: "small round gash in the wood" %>
</figure>

To fix this, I cut out a small piece of wood (pictured above) and used a chisel
to get it to mostly fit before putting it in place with wood glue and wood
filler. It's not very noticeable now:

<%= image_tag "credenza/build-track-04.jpeg", alt: "gash in the wood repaired" %>

I routed the same tracks in the top piece as well. One trick I learned on the
internet somewhere was to make the grooves for the top of the sliding track
deeper. That way, the sliding doors can be removed by lifting them up and then
pulling them out from the bottom. Brilliant.

#### The rest of the dados

Next, I cut the rest of the dados and rabbets for the two dividers and the
backing.

  <%= image_tag "credenza/build-dado-divider.jpeg", alt: "cutting the dado for a divider" %>
  <figcaption>Cutting the dado for a divider. I switched the router off before taking this picture</figcaption>
</figure>

Here's what the bottom and top pieces looked like with the cuts made. You can't
tell so much, but the dados for the dividers were pretty sloppy. I've done
another project since this one and found it easier to use a [top-bearing
flush trim
bit](https://smile.amazon.com/Freud-Bearing-Flush-Shank-50-102/dp/B0000225XQ)
for dados. I'll go more into that on my next project write-up.

<%= image_tag "credenza/build-dados.jpeg", alt: "bottom and top pieces with the dados and rabbets cut" %>

And here it is with the dividers dry-fit in place:

<%= image_tag "credenza/dry-fit-02.jpeg", alt: "Bottom and top assembled with the dividers" %>

### Gluing on the edging

Next up was to cut out and glue on strips of solid walnut to use as front
edging to hide the plywood ends. I ripped the 6' 1x4 piece of walnut I had
picked up into three 7/8" wide strips that were 3/4" thick (the natural thickness
of the 1x4):

<%= image_tag "credenza/edging-pieces.jpeg", alt: "Edging strips ripped from one by four solid walnut" %>

I glued the edging to the front of the top, bottom, and two sides and
used a couple bandy clamps along with lots of tape to clamp it. I was surprised
by how much tape I used on this project. When pulled tight, it has a decent
amount of clamping pressure for small tasks like this.

<%= image_tag "credenza/edging-taped.jpeg", alt: "the top piece with the edging taped and clamped to it" %>

I clamped a scrap piece of wood under to help hold the edging almost flush with the
bottom:

<%= image_tag "credenza/edging-side.jpeg", alt: "side view of the top piece with the edging clamped to it and a scrap piece of wood holding it flush on the bottom" %>

A couple hours later, the glue had dried, and I used a router with a flush trim
bit to cut the edging flush with the boards before sanding it smooth with 80
then 150 grit sandpaper:

<figure>
	<%= image_tag "credenza/edging-routed.jpeg", alt: "board after routing the edging flush with lots of wood shavings covering it" %>
	<figcaption>This part was pretty messy. I'd do it outside in the future</figcaption>
</figure>

### Mitered corners

Next up was to miter the four corners of the box so they would fit together at 45Â° angles.
Since the miters hide the plywood where the top and bottom meet the sides, it
would keep me from having to put edging all the way around the top and bottom
of the credenza. I also like that the mitered corners allowed me to have
continuous grain from the top down to the sides.

The top and bottom pieces wouldn't fit length-wise on my table saw, so I had to
cut the miters by standing the pieces up vertically. I made a jig to hold the
pieces up perpendicular to the table saw and ran them through on that:

<figure>
	<%= image_tag "credenza/miters-jig.jpeg", alt: "jig on the table saw with the bottom piece clamped to it" %>
	<figcaption>Jig with the bottom piece clamped to it</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<%= image_tag "credenza/miters-01.jpeg", alt: "using the jig to cut the bottom piece on the table saw" %>
	<figcaption>Cutting the bottom piece</figcaption>
</figure>

I then ran the side pieces through the table saw without the jig (not
perpendicular) and then dry fit everything together. It was starting to look
pretty nice!

<%= image_tag "credenza/dry-fit-03.jpeg", alt: "assembled credenza, dry fit together" %>

This next part was a little tedious: I disassembled, cut the dividers shorter,
and reassembled repeatedly until the dividers were the right height.
It's almost ready to assemble!

### Give up

My project almost ended here, because I got to the next task on my list and
thought it said "give up". Fortunately, I eventually deciphered my handwriting
and realized it was time to _glue_ everything up!

<%= image_tag "credenza/give-up.jpeg", alt: "task list with a task called 'glue up' that looks like 'give up'" %>

I used only glue on the mitered outer corners. The dividers provide most of the
load bearing structure of the credenza, and the glue is plenty strong enough for
the corners.

The glue I was using dries quickly, so I had to move pretty fast for this bit. I
was very nervous since everything was about to come together, and I had no idea
how it would go. First, I glued the dividers to the bottom, then I glued the
bottom to the side pieces and clamped them at a right angle to the bottom, then
I set the top on. I used ratcheting straps to clamp it all together.

<%= image_tag "credenza/glue-up-01.jpeg", alt: "the dividers in place with glue seeping out between dividers and bottom" %>

<%= image_tag "credenza/glue-up-02.jpeg", alt: "glue on top of side piece, ready for top to be placed" %>

<%= image_tag "credenza/glue-up-06.jpeg", alt: "view of corner from behind with back rabbet visible" %>

You can see one of the sliding doors in this next picture:

### Intermission

Quick break to have a baby. My daughter, Wren, was born 36 hours after the
photos above. Her middle name might be Credenza.

### Door and shelves

OK, we're almost done if you're still with me. After getting back from the
hospital and taking a break from all extracurriculars that didn't involve sleep
for a while, I removed the ratcheting straps and filled gaps in the corners with
wood filler.

After that, next up was for me to make the three shelves that would go in the
credenza and to cut out the cabinet door for the right cabinet. I first made a
little jig and used it to drill peg holes for the shelves in all three cabinets:

<%= image_tag "credenza/shelf-pegs.jpeg", alt: "drilling peg holes using a piece of wood with pre-drilled holes as a jig" %>

I messed up the holes at least once with silly mistakes and had to fill them in
with wood filler. I eventually got them right. Then, I cut the door to size very
carefully. Here you can see the door in place with a
couple shelves:

<%= image_tag "credenza/door-and-shelves.jpeg", alt: "right door in place, along with a shelf in each of the two left cabinets" %>

Next, I glued edging on the shelves and routed and sanded them smooth the same
way I'd done with the other edging pieces. I used thinner strips of edging here
than I used elsewhere.

<%= image_tag "credenza/shelves-glue.jpeg", alt: "three shelves with edging clamped and taped on" %>

For the door, if I'd used edging strips, the seams would have been visible from
the front. For that reason, I opted to use iron-on walnut edge banding that I
found online (not pictured) for the top and sides.

I then installed soft close hinges for the right cabinet door, which was fairly
straightforward. I used a 1 3/8" forstner bit to drill recesses in the cabinet
and then screwed the hinges to the cabinet and door after measuring very
carefully. At this point, I was ready to start finishing!

<%= image_tag "credenza/shelves-done.jpeg", alt: "credenza with door and shelves installed" %>

### Finishing

I wanted the natural walnut to be on display, so I didn't apply any stain. I
finished the credenza with three coats of [General Finishes Arm-R-Seal gloss
urethane
topcoat](https://generalfinishes.com/wood-finishes-retail/oil-based-topcoats/arm-r-seal-oil-based-topcoat).

Before the first coat, I sanded meticulously with 150 grit sandpaper. Between
the second and third coats, I sanded with 320 and 400 grit, respectively. I
mostly followed the techniques from [this video](https://youtu.be/iPtoPBMbAP8),
applying with cotton cloths and sanding between each coat, then wiping off and
applying mineral spirits before applying the urethane. I found the General
Finishes topcoat to be fairly easy to apply.

I hadn't mentioned the legs yet. Since I don't own a lathe and therefore had no
convenient way to taper legs, I opted to buy [these pre-fabbed McCobb style
legs](https://www.tablelegs.com/mccobb-mid-century-modern-feet-straight-cleat-set-4-feet-2-cleats/)
from tablelegs.com in walnut with an 8" length. They were pretty pricey at $145
(after 20% discount), but they are high quality. I also liked that they come
with a cleat for added stability.

Here are the shelves, door, and legs getting the first urethane coat:

<%= image_tag "credenza/finishing-01.jpeg", alt: "shelves and legs with urethane applied" %>

I applied a coat to the bottom of the credenza and the tops of the cabinets
while I had it upside down and then screwed the legs on:

<%= image_tag "credenza/finishing-02.jpeg", alt: "credenza upside down with the legs screwed on and coat applied to bottom and tops of cabinets" %>

Before first coat:

<%= image_tag "credenza/finishing-before-coat-1.jpeg", alt: "credenza before first coat applied, wood is pale and light" %>

After first coat. It's wild how much richer and darker the wood gets, even with a clear coat:

<%= image_tag "credenza/finishing-coat-1.jpeg", alt: "credenza with first coat of urethane, wood much richer and darker" %>

I waited 12 hours, then applied the second coat:

<%= image_tag "credenza/finishing-coat-2.jpeg", alt: "credenza with second coat of urethane applied, looks glossier and smoother" %>

After final coat and hardware installed -- it's finished!

### Cost breakdown

Here's a rough breakdown of the cost.

| Description | Cost |
| -- | -- |
| 3/4" sheet of 4' x 8' walnut plywood | $130 |
| 1/4" sheet of 4' x 8' walnut plywood | $38 |
| 6' piece of 1x4 walnut lumber | $35 |
| 8" walnut legs with cleats | $145 |
| flush pulls for sliding doors | $5 |
| cabinet door pull (set of 4) | $14 |
| cabinet door rubber stop | $6 |
| cabinet hinges | $12 |
| General Finishes Arm-R-Seal Gloss, 1 quart | $26 |
| polyethylene low friction tape to line the door tracks | $3 |
| TiteBond Premium glue | $6|
| walnut iron-on edge banding | $17|
| walnut wood filler | $7 |
| roll of painters tape | $6 |
| <strong>Total</strong> | <strong>$450</strong> |
{: .totals-table }

<p></p>

The wood was a major part of the total cost, along with the legs. I've built a
TV stand since this project and was able to cut down the cost significantly by
using a cheaper wood (birch) and building my own legs. I think the total cost
was around $100 to $150. I'm hoping to do a write-up on that project soon.

I bought _lots_ of other tools and pieces of equipment for this project that I
didn't list above since they aren't expendable and wouldn't be required if you
already owned them. These things might have totalled up to around $800 for me
and included a table saw ($300), router ($200), router bit set, Home Depot
truck rental, earmuffs and dust masks, bandy clamps, mineral spirits, tack
cloths, sandpaper (I had some grits already, bought others), and chisels, among
other things.

I also used lots of other tools and things that I already owned, including a
miter saw, circular saw, drill, drill bits, clamps, a T-square, tape measures,
a brad nailer for the backing, ratcheting straps, and other smaller tools.

### It's done

This project was an immense learning experience for me, and I couldn't be more
pleased with the result. It was also incredibly difficult. I found myself
obsessed, unable to sleep at night during this two month project as I lay awake
thinking about what I needed to learn and second-guessing decisions. I was
miserable, and I was also alive. I think I'll do this again.
