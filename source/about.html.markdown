Hi, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹. I'm Stephen Hanson, an Austin-based web and
mobile developer. I currently work as Development Director at a digital agency
called [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), where I help clients bring their
web and mobile ideas to life.

I'm motivated by building. I get satisfaction from making things that are useful
and delightful. That's why I built [the office I work out
of](/building-my-backyard-office) and [furniture in my
home](/building-a-credenza), and it's also why I built open source tools like
[Fishery](https://github.com/thoughtbot/fishery) and
[Belt](https://github.com/thoughtbot/belt).

I'm a generalist, with some deep specializations. I'm happiest in positions
where I can have a large impact. I enjoy working across the stack and across
teams, implementing mission-critical features from end-to-end. Over the course
of my 13 year career, I've worked in many different technologies, with recent
years focused on React, React Native, Ruby on Rails, and Node.
