Hi, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹. I'm Stephen Hanson, an Austin-based web and
mobile developer currently working at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com),
where I spend most of my time working with React, React Native, and Rails to
help bring ideas to life.

I have 10 years experience as a software developer and have been consulting
since 2012. In that time, I've worked for companies such as Houseparty, American
Airlines, National Breast Cancer Foundation, Ticketmaster, Qeepsake, Frito
Lay, Pep Boys, Airrosti, StudioHop, and many more.
