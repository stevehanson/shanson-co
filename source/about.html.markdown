Hi, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹. I'm Stephen Hanson, an Austin-based web and mobile
developer currently working at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), where I
spend most of my time working with React, React Native, and Rails. I
[tweet](https://twitter.com/stephenhanson) on Twitter and [write
code](https://github.com/stevehanson) on GitHub.

I write on here very seldomly and usually about random topics. Good luck!
