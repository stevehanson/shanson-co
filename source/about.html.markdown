Hi, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹. I'm Stephen Hanson, an Austin-based web and
mobile developer currently working at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com),
where I spend most of my time working with React, React Native, and Rails to
help bring my clients' ideas to life.

I have over 10 years of experience as a software developer and have been
consulting for almost as long. I've had the privilege of working for companies
such as Houseparty, American Airlines, National Breast Cancer Foundation,
Ticketmaster, Qeepsake, Frito Lay, Pep Boys, StudioHop, and many more.
