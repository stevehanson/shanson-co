Hey-o. I'm Steve Hanson, or shanson, if you will. I'm an Austin-based web developer currently doing freelance work. I [tweet](http://twitter.com/stephenhanson) on Twitter and [write code](http://github.com/stevehanson) on GitHub.

I post more than just code on this site, because I believe in using this platform to share who I am as a person, rather than just as a developer. I know that many of you who stumble here are not as interested in me as a person, and to you I say "sorry for the noise :)".

You can get to know me here:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stephenhanson)
* [Instagram](http://instagram.com/steve_hanson)
* [GitHub](http://github.com/stevehanson)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/680847/steve-hanson)

Or, contact me [by email](mailto:steve@shanson.co?subject=Hello from shanson.co).

#### Behind the curtain

I built this site using Rails and a custom admin built in Ember.js. You can check out the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/stevehanson/shanson-co) or [read more about it](/building-this-site).

Type is set in [Bitter](http://www.huertatipografica.com/fonts/bitter-ht) and [PT Sans](http://www.paratype.com/public/).
